# focus-ai-to-do

A Flutter-based productivity app prototype that explores how AI can help users extract, split, organize, and plan tasks for more focused execution.

## Project Overview

focus-ai-to-do is a Flutter-based productivity app prototype designed to explore how AI can support task organization and task initiation. The project combines basic to-do management with AI-assisted task splitting, planning, and information extraction, aiming to reduce the friction users face when turning vague or lengthy input into actionable steps.

In addition to task management features, the project also experiments with interface elements such as video backgrounds to create a more engaging and focus-oriented user experience.

## Problem Statement

Many users do not struggle with having too few tasks, but with knowing how to begin. Long instructions, unclear goals, and multiple overlapping responsibilities can make it difficult to identify priorities and turn information into manageable actions.

While many to-do tools help users record tasks, they do not always help users interpret, structure, and start them. This project was built to explore how AI can support that transition from raw information to practical execution.

## Target Users

This project is mainly designed for:

- students managing assignments, deadlines, and study plans
- users who struggle with task initiation when facing large or unclear tasks
- users who receive long text or verbal instructions and need help extracting key action items
- users who prefer a lighter and more guided way to organize daily tasks

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **AI Task Splitting**  
  Breaks down larger tasks into smaller and more manageable subtasks.

- **Task Planning**  
  Suggests a clearer order for working through tasks based on priority and due dates.

- **Task Management**  
  Supports creating, editing, deleting, and tracking to-do items.

- **AI-Assisted Information Extraction**  
  Explores how longer user input can be turned into more structured and actionable task items.

### UI / Interaction Exploration

- **Video Background**  
  Integrates a local video asset (`assets/video/bg.mp4`) as part of the interface experiment.

- **Material Design UI**  
  Built with Flutter’s Material Design components.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Language:** Dart
- **State Management:** Provider
- **Networking:** HTTP
- **Media Integration:** video_player, chewie
- **Utilities:** uuid
- **UI:** Material Design

## How to Run

### Requirements

* Flutter SDK installed
* Dart SDK compatible with the project environment
* iOS, Android, or another Flutter-supported platform

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/woshixiyangyang/focus_ai_todo.git
   cd focus_ai_todo
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## How It Works

* **Creating a task:** Users can add a task from the home screen by entering a title and description.
* **Using AI to split tasks:** From the task details screen, users can ask the app to break a larger task into smaller steps.
* **Viewing planned tasks:** The app organizes tasks by priority and due date to suggest a more manageable working order.

## Current Status

This project has completed its core prototype structure and README documentation. Basic task management, task planning, video-based interface experimentation, and AI-assisted workflow exploration have been implemented in the current version.

## Future Improvements

* improve the quality and reliability of AI-generated task suggestions
* refine task prioritization and planning logic
* add support for recurring tasks and reminders
* improve the transition from information input to task execution
* enhance user feedback and task organization options
* expand cross-platform polish and usability
